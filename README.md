## DualSIM
it is an android application for dua-sim android phones. This app automatically selects the cheapest SIM while doing outgoing call. Rates of call varies at different hours of the day based on different packages used by users. Often time users do not bother to calculate the cost of the SIMs before using. In fact it is quite difficult to do so as the rates varries frequently. The user survey on the partially implemented app suggests 45% average reduction in cost.
the app-debug.apk is the application file. As it was implemented on an older version of android, it might not work properly. Some snippets of the implemented app is attached below.
